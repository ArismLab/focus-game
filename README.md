## Q2-1 2024 - Testnet Launch: Alpha Release
- **Alpha Version Development**
  - Basic gameplay mechanics implementation
    - **LEVEL**: Starting at level 1 having 5 maxPoints, claim NFTs to increase, level up to increase.
    - **HONEY, BEAR, STRK**: Spin Wheels to Receive (1 free spin daily, subsequent spins require BEAR interaction with the contract → Burn BEAR and pay STRK fee) (cost 1 BEAR → 3, 5 , 10 BEAR (3 SLOT), 10 STRK, 20 STRK, remaining rewards are HONEY).
    - **NBEAR**: Focus to Earn
      - Must focus for at least 1 hour to earn BEAR tokens (up to maxBEAR). Subsequent hours earn + HONEY. Must claim maxBEAR to wallet before continuing focus, otherwise no earnings.
    - **HONEY**: Use to buy HoneyJar → HoneyJar boosts farming strength for BEAR, reducing focus time from 1 hour to 30 minutes.
    - Open chests to get NFTs to increase maxBEAR (level), requires HONEY to open, and txs fee to claim.
    - Claim default NFTs to get maxBEAR points → can claim free without HONEY, but need txs fee.
    - **4 gas-free transactions** each user.
